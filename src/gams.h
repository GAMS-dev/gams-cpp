/// <p>The GAMS namespace provides objects to interact with the General Algebraic Modeling
/// System (GAMS). Objects in this namespace allow convenient exchange of input data
/// and model results (GAMSDatabase), help to create and run GAMS models (GAMSJob),
/// that can be customized by GAMS options (GAMSOptions). Furthermore, it
/// introduces a way to solve a sequence of closely related model instances in the
/// most efficient way (GAMSModelInstance).</p>
/// <p>The underlying GAMS engine relies to some extent on file based communication
/// (e.g. the listing file) and other low-level resources. A GAMS program can include
/// other source files (e.g. $include), load data from
/// GDX files (e.g. $GDXIN or execute_load), and create PUT files. All these files
/// can be specified with a (relative) path and therefore an anchor into the file
/// system is required. The base class GAMSWorkspace manages the anchor to the file
/// system. If external file communication is not an issue in a particular application,
/// temporary directories and files will be managed by objects within the library.</p>
/// <p>With the exception of GAMSWorkspace the objects in the GAMS namespace cannot be
/// accessed across different threads unless the instance is locked. The classes themself
/// are thread safe and multiple objects of the class can be used from different threads
/// (see below for restrictions on solvers that are not thread safe within the
/// GAMSModelInstance class).</p>
/// <p>Note: If you use multiple instances of the GAMSWorkspace in parallel, you should
/// avoid using the same WorkingDirectory. Otherwise you may end up with conflicting
/// file names.</p>
/// <p>This version of the GAMS namespace lacks support for the following GAMS
/// components:</p>
/// <p>Acronyms, support for GAMS compilation/execution errors
/// (GAMSJob.Run just throws an exception), structured access to listing file, and
/// proper support for solver options.</p>
/// <p>Currently only CplexD and Gurobi fully utilize the power of solving
/// GAMSModelInstances. Some solvers will not even work in a multi-threaded
/// application using GAMSModelInstances. For some solvers this is unavoidable
/// because the solver library is not thread safe (e.g. MINOS), other solvers are
/// in principle thread safe but the GAMS link is not (e.g. Cplex, note there is a
/// thread safe version of Cplex called CplexD which lack some minor features e.g.
/// support for BCH framework). Moreover, GAMSModelInstances are not available for quadratic
/// model types (QCP, MIQCP, RMIQCP).</p>
/// <p>There are examples in C++ using this API in [GAMS system]\\apifiles.</p>
