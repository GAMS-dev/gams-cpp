/// the job can be provided as a string or by a filename (relative to the working
/// directory of the GAMSWorkspace) of a text file containing the GAMS model source.
/// The Run method organizes the export of the input GAMSDatabases, calls the GAMS
/// compiler and execution system with the supplied options and on successful
/// completion provides through the method OutDB (of type GAMSDatabase) the
/// results of the model run.</p>
/// <p>While the result data is captured in a GAMSDatabase, the Run method can also
/// create a GAMSCheckpoint that not only captures data but represents the state of
/// the entire GAMSJob and allows some other GAMSJob to continue from this state.
/// In case of a compilation or execution error, the Run method will throw an
/// exception. If the log output of GAMS is of interest, it can be captured by
/// providing a TextWriter instance.</p>
